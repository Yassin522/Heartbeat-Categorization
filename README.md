# Heartbeat Categorization

## About The Project
Heartbeat Categorization is a machine learning project focused on classifying heartbeats as normal or abnormal. Utilizing a dataset of ECG (electrocardiogram) signals, this model aims to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities. The dataset comprises ECG recordings collected from patients and annotated by medical professionals, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the training data.

## Key Features
- **ECG Signal Analysis:** Processes ECG data to extract meaningful features for classification.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Employs advanced algorithms to distinguish between normal and abnormal heartbeats.
- **Medical Data Handling:** Carefully handles sensitive medical data, maintaining patient confidentiality and data integrity.
